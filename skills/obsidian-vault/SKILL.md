# Obsidian Vault Management

CRUD operations, search, frontmatter management, and daily notes for the Obsidian vault via the official Obsidian CLI.

**Vault:** Brain (default, no `-v` flag needed)
**Vault path:** `/Users/jnk789/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Brain/`
**Tool:** `obsidian-cli` v0.2.2 via Bash
**Binary:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/obsidian-cli` (NOT `obsidian` — that's the Electron app)
**Suppress warnings:** Always append `2>/dev/null` to commands

**RELATED SKILLS:**
- For deep-decoding research papers → `research-papers`
- For processing sources into atomic zettels → `zettelkasten`
- For in-session thinking work → `deep-work`
- For idea capture and queue → `idea-queue`

---

## CLI Syntax

All commands use **positional arguments** for note names/paths, and **flags** for options:

```
obsidian-cli <command> "<note name or path>" [flags] 2>/dev/null
```

- Note names are fuzzy-matched (like wikilinks — no path or `.md` extension needed)
- For notes in subfolders, use the relative path from vault root: `"10_SOURCES/My Note"`
- Quote names with spaces: `"Job Applications Log"`
- The vault is already set to Brain — omit `-v` flag

---

## Available Commands (v0.2.2)

There are exactly **12 commands**. Do NOT use any other command names.

| Command | Alias | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `print` | `p` | Print note contents to stdout |
| `create` | `c` | Create a new note (or append to existing) |
| `open` | `o` | Open note in Obsidian app |
| `search` | `s` | Fuzzy search and open note in Obsidian |
| `search-content` | `sc` | Search note content for a term (requires Obsidian running) |
| `move` | `m` | Move or rename note (updates links) |
| `delete` | `d` | Delete note from vault |
| `daily` | `d` | Create or open daily note |
| `frontmatter` | `fm` | View or modify YAML frontmatter |
| `print-default` | | Print default vault name and path |
| `set-default` | `sd` | Set default vault |
| `completion` | | Generate shell autocompletion |

---

## Core Operations

### Read / Print a Note

```bash
# Print note contents (fuzzy name match)
obsidian-cli print "Job Applications Log" 2>/dev/null

# Print note with linked mentions included
obsidian-cli print "PPO" -m 2>/dev/null

# Print note from a specific folder path
obsidian-cli print "10_SOURCES/Job Applications Log" 2>/dev/null
```

### Create a Note

```bash
# Create a new note with content
obsidian-cli create "00_INBOX/Quick Thought" -c "# Quick Thought\n\nContent here" 2>/dev/null

# Create in a specific folder
obsidian-cli create "10_SOURCES/New Paper" -c "# New Paper\n\nNotes..." 2>/dev/null

# Create and open in Obsidian
obsidian-cli create "30_PROJECTS/New Project" -c "# Project" --open 2>/dev/null

# Overwrite an existing note
obsidian-cli create "00_INBOX/Existing Note" -c "Replaced content" -o 2>/dev/null
```

### Append to a Note

```bash
# Append content to an existing note (uses create with -a flag)
obsidian-cli create "Research Notes" -c "\n## New Section\nContent here" -a 2>/dev/null

# Append a task to the daily note — first get daily note, then append
# (No direct daily-append command exists)
```

### Search

```bash
# Fuzzy search by name and open in Obsidian
obsidian-cli search "transformer" 2>/dev/null

# Search note CONTENT for a term (requires Obsidian app running)
obsidian-cli search-content "attention mechanism" 2>/dev/null

# Open in editor instead of Obsidian
obsidian-cli search-content "RLHF" -e 2>/dev/null
```

**Note:** `search-content` requires Obsidian app to be running. If it fails, fall back to using the Read tool directly on vault files, or use `ast-grep`/grep on the vault path.

### Move / Rename

```bash
# Move a note (takes 2 positional args: source, destination)
obsidian-cli move "Quick Thought" "10_SOURCES/Quick Thought" 2>/dev/null

# Rename a note (move to same folder with new name)
obsidian-cli move "Old Name" "New Name" 2>/dev/null

# Move and open in Obsidian
obsidian-cli move "Draft" "10_SOURCES/Final" -o 2>/dev/null
```

### Delete

```bash
# Delete a note (moves to .trash/)
obsidian-cli delete "Outdated Note" 2>/dev/null

# Delete note in a subfolder
obsidian-cli delete "00_INBOX/Temp Note" 2>/dev/null
```

### Open in Obsidian

```bash
# Open note in Obsidian app
obsidian-cli open "Job Applications Log" 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Frontmatter (Properties)

```bash
# Print all frontmatter for a note
obsidian-cli frontmatter "PPO Paper" --print 2>/dev/null

# Edit a frontmatter key
obsidian-cli frontmatter "PPO Paper" --edit --key "status" --value "done" 2>/dev/null

# Delete a frontmatter key
obsidian-cli frontmatter "PPO Paper" --delete --key "draft" 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Daily Notes

```bash
# Create or open today's daily note in Obsidian
obsidian-cli daily 2>/dev/null
```

**Note:** The CLI only has one `daily` command — it creates/opens the daily note. There is no `daily:read`, `daily:append`, or `daily:path` command. To read/append to the daily note, find its path first (it follows the vault's daily note template pattern in `80_JOURNALS/`) and use `print` or `create -a` with the full path.

---

## Vault Info

```bash
# Print default vault name and path
obsidian-cli print-default 2>/dev/null

# Set default vault
obsidian-cli set-default "Brain" 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Vault Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00_INBOX` | Quick captures, unsorted notes |
| `10_SOURCES` | Literature notes, references |
| `20_ZETTLEKASTEN` | Atomic permanent notes |
| `30_PROJECTS` | Active project notes |
| `40_TAGS` | Tag index notes |
| `50_MOC` | Maps of Content |
| `60_TEMPLATES` | Note templates |
| `70_ASSETS` | Images, attachments |
| `80_JOURNALS` | Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly |
| `90_BOARDS` | Kanban/board views |
| `100_IDEAS` | Idea notes |
| `110_BUNDLES` | Assembled bundles for export |

---

## Limitations (v0.2.2)

The CLI is lightweight. These features are **NOT available**:
- No `backlinks`, `links`, `orphans`, `deadends`, `unresolved` commands
- No `tags`, `tasks` commands
- No `templates`, `template:read`, `template:insert` commands
- No `history`, `diff`, `history:restore` commands
- No `files`, `folders`, `wordcount`, `recents` commands
- No `daily:read`, `daily:append`, `daily:prepend` commands
- No `--copy` flag
- No `key=value` parameter syntax — use positional args and flags only

**Workarounds:**
- To read daily note: find the file in `80_JOURNALS/` and use `print`
- To append to daily: find the file and use `create "<path>" -c "content" -a`
- To list files/folders: use Bash `ls` on the vault path
- To search content when Obsidian is closed: use the Read tool directly on vault files
- For backlinks, tags, tasks: use the Obsidian app directly or search vault files with grep/Read

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Confirm before destructive ops.** Before delete, move, or overwrite (`-o`) — state the action and ask the user to confirm.
2. **Read before edit.** Always `print` a note before modifying it with append to understand current state.
3. **No binary files.** Only operate on `.md` files through the CLI.
4. **Check existence before create.** Use `print` to check if a note exists before creating (it will error if not found).
5. **Respect skill boundaries.** Route to research-papers, zettelkasten, deep-work, or idea-queue when appropriate.

---

## Fallback: Direct File Access

When `obsidian-cli` commands fail (Obsidian not running, CLI limitations), fall back to direct file operations on the vault path:

```
/Users/jnk789/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Brain/
```

- Use the **Read** tool to read vault files directly
- Use the **Edit** tool for targeted edits to vault files (better for long content than CLI append)
- Use **Bash `ls`** to list vault folders and files

The CLI is preferred for fuzzy name matching and link-aware moves, but direct file access is a reliable fallback.
